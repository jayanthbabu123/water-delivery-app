I apologize, but I am not able to create or generate actual binary image files like PNGs directly. PNG files are binary data and cannot be represented as text content within backticks.

For implementing the water drop logo, you would need to:

1. Use an image editing tool (like Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Figma, etc.) to create the PNG file from the SVG design we created
2. The PNG should be:
   - 1024x1024 pixels for the app icon
   - Use a transparent background
   - Have high quality anti-aliasing
   - Follow the water drop design from our SVG
   - Use the blue gradient colors (#2196F3 to #1976D2)

Would you like me to:
1. Suggest a different approach for implementing the splash screen?
2. Provide guidance on creating the PNG using specific design tools?
3. Help modify the app configuration to work with your existing logo files?
