I cannot directly create binary files like PNG images through text output. PNG files contain binary data that cannot be represented accurately in plain text format within this conversation.

To create a profile avatar image, you would need to:

1. Use an image creation tool or service
2. Download a suitable avatar image from a stock photo site
3. Create the image using design software like Photoshop or Sketch

For your project, I suggest either:
- Using an existing image in your assets (I see you have avatar.svg which could be used instead)
- Using a default image from a library like react-native-elements
- Using an icon from @expo/vector-icons as a placeholder

Would you like me to update your code to use one of these alternatives instead?
